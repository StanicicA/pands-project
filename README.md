The Iris Dataset contains following features: length and width of sepals and  petals of 50 samples of three species of Iris:
```
 1. Iris setosa 
 2. Iris virginica
 3. Iris versicolor

These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
