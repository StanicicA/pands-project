## The Irish Data Set
```bash
The Iris Dataset contains features like length and width of sepals and petals of 50 samples of three species of Iris:
```
 1. **Iris setosa**
 2. **Iris virginica**
 3. **Iris versicolor**
 ```
These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.
```
## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique to analyze data using some visual Techniques. With this technique, we can get detailed information about the statistical summary of the data. We will also be able to deal with the duplicates values, outliers, and also see some trends or patterns present in the dataset.

## Correlations between Variables
